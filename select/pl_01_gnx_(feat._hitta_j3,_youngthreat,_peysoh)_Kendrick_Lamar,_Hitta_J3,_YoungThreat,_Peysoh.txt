Tell 'em Kendrick did it,
ayy, who showed you how
to run a blitz?
Tell 'em Kendrick did it,
who put the West back
in front of shit?
Tell 'em Kendrick did it,
ayy, I'm trippin'
and I'm lovin' it
Tell 'em Kendrick did it,
like, wha—
Hi, have you ever been
a joint and you know it?
Have you ever had to flip
your unemployment?
On the dead guys, nigga,
I ain't goin'
Ayy, on the dead ones
We'll treat an enemigo
like some bread crumbs
All of my killers on go,
like, who said somethin'?
Redrum, all I think about
when I see heads comе
Do my dance, hit the chop
when I see opps go
Lеt 'em claim it, we the
ones who really pop, bro
Don't televise it, we the
ones who lettin' chops blow
Opps know, let 'em piss
him off and it's a flop show
Murder man, singin' murder
music off a murder van
Beat the pussy up like I
been celibate and I murder sound
Who is him? One and only
shotta, known as murder man
Catch you doin' dirty, it's
no other way but murder plans
I broke her heart and you
the type to go and fix it
Don't wanna speak if you
ain't talkin' 'bout no ticket
I'm bougie with it, but I
might just let you kiss it
Hit that block with diamonds
on me, you could tell 'em
Peysoh did it
Tell 'em Peysoh did it, ayy,
who showed you how to
run a blitz?
Tell 'em Peysoh did it, who
put the West back in front
of shit?
Tell 'em Peysoh did it, ayy,
I'm trippin' and I'm lovin' it
Tell 'em Peysoh did it,
like, wha—
Hi, have you ever been a
joint and you know it?
Have you ever had to flip
your unemployment?
On the dead guys, nigga,
I ain't goin'
Hop out suicide doors,
it's the Hitta, man
You don't wanna see them
doors slidin' on the Caravan
I know killers who was
catchin' bodies and not one fade
I was thirteen up at
Avalon, poppin' chains
Fourteen, ridin' minibikes
with some dead friends
Twenty-one, flag on my head
like a Taliban
Twenty-five, feelin' like
the box, it was full of sand
At the cemetery, fuck that,
that's where I could've been
142nd, I'm connected like I'm
Rosecrans
Kinda shit I seen, try and
forget and I will pop a Xan'
Uppin' scores, doin' files,
sacrifices like a boxing ring
Can't throw in the towel,
pistol-packin' since a child
Ayy, like it's Iraq, shooter
name Hussein
Ridin' with the dirty blicky,
switchy, make a new flame
She said I been a dog all my
life, bae, can you change?
True to my religion, Cuban
links, more than two chains
Tell 'em Hitta did it, ayy,
who showed you how to run
a blitz?
Tell 'em Hitta did it, who
put the West back in front
of shit?
Tell 'em Hitta did it, ayy,
I'm trippin' and I'm lovin' it
It's gettin' down to the wire
Get on my Bob the Builder
shit, get down with the pliers
Been comin' back-to-back
hits, how this nigga ain't
tired?
I'm with some rockstar
bitches, they want Lizzie
McGuire
I'm switchin' gears, I pop
the clutch, I'll send a nigga up
A risk-taker, I'll call
you niggas' bluff
If they hangin' out for real,
we come deduct, tuckin' tails,
they out of luck
When it's wartime, they
hidin' in the cut
Y'all had y'all chance,
y'all couldn't do it
I swear I'm comin' worse than
y'all baby moms, I'm puttin'
niggas through it
They hate to see me doin' it
Meal ticket, I'm pursuin' it
I'm in the field for real,
UCLA Bruins
They askin' how I do it, how a
young nigga so fluent
I kept my mouth closed and I
ain't never leave no witness
D.O.A. up on the scene,
tell 'em YoungThreat
did it, nigga
